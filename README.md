# SAEON Dash Applications

A repository of [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) applications developed
by the SAEON uLwazi Node's Data Science Team.

## Development

### Initial setup
First, browse to the SAEON [Dash_applications](https://github.com/SAEONData/Dash_applications)
repository, and click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the repository
under your own GitHub account.

Then, clone the fork to your local computer:

    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Dash_applications.git

Switch to the `Dash_applications` directory:

    cd Dash_applications/

Create a Python virtual environment:

    python -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment:

#### On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    
#### On Linux and mac
    source .venv/bin/activate

Install Dash and other packages to the Virtual Environment  
    
    pip install -U pip setuptools pip-tools
    pip-sync

Now you can open the `Dash_applications` folder as a project in the PyCharm IDE.

### General notes
* `@app.callback` outputs must have a unique name for each app

## Deployment

The Dash Server is a linux server located at 192.168.117.49

Ask Sephy to create a username and password for you on that server and you will be able to SSH onto the server.

After Accessing the server, switch to the root user by typing `sudo -s`.
Then, `cd` to the `cd /srv/Dash_applications` directory and run the following
commands to update the deployed Dash apps:

    git pull
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d

## Admin

### Managing dependencies
The `requirements.txt` file defines exactly which packages - and which versions
of those packages - must be installed to the Python virtual environment, for both
local development and server deployments.

`requirements.txt` is compiled from `requirements.in` using the `pip-compile` command.

To add a Python package - e.g. pandas - that is referenced by any module in this
repository, first add it to `requirements.in` file. Then, run:

    pip-compile

To upgrade existing referenced packages or their dependencies, run:

    pip-compile --upgrade

Your local virtual environment can then be updated with any new or updated packages
using the following command:

    pip-sync

Note that, after upgrading any packages or their dependencies, it's a good idea
to test that everything works as expected, before committing the updated
`requirements.txt` to source control.
